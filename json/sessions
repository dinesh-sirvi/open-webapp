They specify the communication protocol that allows the OS to interact with a device. However, drivers for new devices are usually created for a specific OS version. These drivers often need to be backported to the older versions to allow use of the new device. Backporting is often done manually, and is tedious and error prone. To alleviate this burden on developers, we propose an automatic recommendation system to guide the selection of backporting changes. Our approach analyzes the version history for cues to recommend candidate changes. We have performed an experiment on 100 Linux driver files and have shown that we can give a recommendation containing the correct backport for 68 of the drivers. For these 68 cases, 73.5%, 85.3%, and 88.2% of the correct recommendations are located in the Top-1, Top-2, and Top-5 positions of the recommendation lists respectively. The successful cases cover various kinds of changes including change of record access, deletion of function argument, change of a function name, change of constant, and change of if condition. Manual investigation of failed cases highlights limitations of our approach, including inability to infer complex changes, and unavailability of relevant cues in version history.

To deal with this the OpenStack community has developed and deployed several tools to help deal with the torrent of data.

The work has been done in association with a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) called SAHI,  Society to Aid the Hearing Impaired which is part of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad. SAHI supports the hearing impaired kids for Cochlear implant surgery so that the kids audibility increases. After the surgery audio therapy is given to kids for better understanding of the surrounding world. By using free and open source web applications, MIT App Inventor, various mobile Apps have been developed for the better learning of the kids. The learning of the impaired kids have been cleared explained by the special teachers to the developers. This made to develop Apps more clearly, concisely and perfectly. Different Apps were done keeping in the view of international standard of teaching to special kids who are hearing impaired. The Apps developed covered variety of topics such as Early Vocabulary,Vehicle and Voice Sounds, Syllable Length Word (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu), Discriminate Consonant, Same Length Words (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu), Leaning by Manner, Learning of Colors, Learning various Poems (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu) and explaining short Stories(in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu). The Apps have been done in both English and native languages too keeping in view of the therapy requested by the kid's parents. Tests are also included in the Apps to know the level of learning. During initial stages, suggestions were given by audiologists, special teachers and counselors. After continuous and rigorous reviews and feedbacks, the apps developed had become satisfactory to all the special trainers and was ready to use. They were given to the challenged kids for testing as a part of their learning. The results found by the teachers were astounding. Children are showing more interest to learn on mobile rather than book. The duration of attention  towards learning of the kid has drastically improved. Teachers training the special kids are very happy with this m-learning (Mobile learning). Parents too found it to be amazing as their kids show more interest towards learning through mobile. Also, now they are very much comfortable to train the kids at their homes by using these Apps. The parents are very excited to get all these learning Apps shared to their mobiles.  It  is a great feeling of satisfaction to see kids interested to learn and the parents with bright smile on their face. This all happened by developing learning Apps of open-source software.

This gives rise to the need for heterogeneous computing.Heterogeneous computing refers to systems that use more than one kind of processor or cores. </span><span style=\"\">These systems gain performance or energy efficiency not just by adding the same type of processors, but by adding dissimilar co-processors, usually incorporating specialized processing capabilities to handle particular tasks.</span><span style=\"\">There are a number of heterogeneous devices that are readily available off the shelf, some of them as commercially available system on chips (SoCs) and can be easily accessible to the average embedded software programmer. These heterogeneous devices incorporate hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs. The advantages of having multiple types of hardware accelerators within a system on chip are many, such as high-performance gains and specificity of tasks performed. One of the major issues is the exotic programming model that each hardware accelerator brings along with it. </span><span style=\"\">FPGAs bring along the requirement to write accelerators using hardware description language (HDL) at a very low level of abstraction (register transfer level) which has a really steep learning curve, extremely long compilation/place and route timings and are relatively difficult to debug. GPUs have their own programming languages and until a few years ago GPUs were used predominantly for graphics processing as the name suggests. However off late, with computing problems of large sizes and datasets, a lot of computations are being off-loaded to the GPU due to its benefit in parallel execution. </span><span style=\"\">Even with a great number of devices available, the difference in programming models makes it difficult to truly use all these devices in unison. </span><span style=\"\">Even with these multitudes of methods available for hardware acceleration, it is still not possible for software developers to adopt and use these devices as part of their daily routine for hardware acceleration.

The toolbox seamlessly allows to easily combine multiple data representations, algorithm classes, and general purpose tools. This enables both rapid prototyping of data pipelines and extensibility in terms of new algorithms. We combine modern software architecture in C++ with both efficient low-level computing backends and cutting edge algorithm implementations to solve large-scale Machine Learning problems (yet) on single machines.One of Shogun's most exciting features is that you can use the toolbox through a unified interface from C++, Python, Octave, R, Java, Lua, C#, Ruby, etc. This not just means that we are independent of trends in computing languages, but it also lets you use Shogun as a vehicle to expose your algorithm to multiple communities. We use SWIG to enable bidirectional communication between C++ and target languages.\u00a0One of the focus point of the talk is the introduction of the meta-example framework developed as part of the toolbox: a user can write an example use-case for a method using our 'meta-example' syntax, that would then be auto-translated into all of the supported languages of the library. This not only allows us to easily scale with the number of new methods in the sense of having the example use-cases of the method being exposed to all of the target languages, but it allows us to have those methods tested throughout of all the languages.Originally focussing on large-scale kernel methods and bioinformatics, the toolbox saw massive extensions to other fields in recent years. It now offers features that span the whole space of Machine Learning methods, including many classical methods in classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, but also more advanced algorithm classes such as metric, multi-task, structured output, and online learning, as well as feature hashing, ensemble methods, and optimization, just to name a few. Shogun in addition contains a number of exclusive state-of-the art algorithms such as a wealth of efficient SVM implementations, Multiple Kernel Learning, kernel hypothesis testing, Krylov methods, etc. All algorithms are supported by a collection of general purpose methods for evaluation, parameter tuning, preprocessing, serialisation &amp; I/O, etc; the resulting combinatorial possibilities are huge.</p>", "speakers": [{"speaking_experience": "", "city": "Singapore", "short_biography": "<p><span style=\"\">Viktor Gal is currently working as a data scientist.

It can be seen as an extension of NLTK, but with special consideration for the unique needs of historical languages. It provides basic functions for many languages (e.g., n-grams, word frequencies, word tokenization) and wider support for several languages (Greek and Latin) that includes text normalization, sentence tokenizer, POS tagging, and named entity recognition (NER). We plan to extend to other languages, as well.</span><span style=\"\">The CLTK Archive is a website I worked on during my GSoC project. It's a web app front-end to the CLTK core and also provides a modern reading environment for interacting with ancient texts. The Archive aims to provide an aesthetically-pleasing yet utilitarian environment that facilitates reading, note taking, and learning. It presents Classical texts in an easy-to-read layout with metadata like translation, commentary, and word definitions. The site is backed up by a Flask based REST API that provides access to text corpora and other functions of the core CLTK package.\u00a0</span><span style=\"\">I will also be giving a short demos of the capabilities of the Python library and CLTK Archive website (available soon as an alpha release).</span></p>", "speakers": [{"speaking_experience": "", "city": "Delhi", "short_biography": "<p><span style=\"\">I'm a recent graduate from NSIT, Delhi with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology.
